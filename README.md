# auto-copy-date-time
 Automatically add the date and time to the clipboard each minute for easy pasting using the Pyperclip Library.

### Notes - WIP
This is a super simples script created for some mild automation for logging calls or other tasks requiring manually logged times.

#### Future updates may include:
 - Clearing of last time-date clipboard entry on minute change.
 - Option for script pause or exit on copy of other item to clipboard.
